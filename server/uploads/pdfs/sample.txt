To test the PDF functionality:

1. Make sure your server is running
2. Try adding a book with a valid PDF URL (must point to a publicly accessible PDF)
3. Or use the PDF uploader component to upload a PDF directly
4. When viewing a book with a PDF, click the "Read Now" button

Common issues:
- Some PDF links may be blocked by CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- Make sure the PDF URL ends with .pdf or points to a real PDF file
- Check your browser console for errors if the PDF doesn't load
- Make sure the server can access the uploads directory
